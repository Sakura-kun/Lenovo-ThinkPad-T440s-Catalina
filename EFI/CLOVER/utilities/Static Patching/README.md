# Static Patches From Lenovo ThinkPad T450

These are patches which are meant to be applied directly to the DSDT.dsl (decompiled DSDT.aml file) on Lenovo ThinkPad T440, T440s, T450, and T450s Ultrabooks when opting to go with the Static Patch method for resolving issues with the stock ACPI configuration of the systems listed above when putting together a completed macOS Mojave Hackintosh build. The patches require the systems DSDT.aml to be decompiled into .dsl format which can be accomplished using the iasl binary which can be found on RehabMan's BitBucket page. These are the required patches necessary for resolving a number of issues that are present in the stock ACPI configuration when running macOS Mojave.
